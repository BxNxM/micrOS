# micrOS: Small Core, Fair Future  
*A Community-Driven Future for Embedded Systems*  

Welcome to **micrOS** — an async mini operating system built on top of [MicroPython](https://micropython.org).  
This project is not just about code — it’s about **building a fair, sustainable, and community-driven ecosystem** where contributors, partners, and users all share in the success.  

Think of MicroPython as the engine — **micrOS is the async brain that organizes and extends it.**

---

## What is micrOS?  
micrOS provides a **minimal async core** with scalable **Load Modules (LMs)**, applications, and developer tools.  
It’s designed to stay small but grow with the needs of **IoT and embedded projects**.  

- ⚡ Async by design  
- 🧩 Modular, expandable with LMs  
- 📦 Applications & tools included  
- 🌍 Built for community contribution and shared success  

---

## Business Model  

- **Free** for personal use and prototyping.  
- **Commercial use**: 5% of product profit under a dual license.  
  - AGPL-3.0 for personal/prototyping.  
  - Commercial license for products.  
- **5% of all revenue goes back to MicroPython**, as tribute and reinvestment.  

**Hardware partners and investors** also pay the 5% license fee when selling micrOS-powered products.  
- If they contribute code or hardware, they can **earn from the contributor pools** — offsetting part of their license costs through adoption.  

---

## Contribution & Reward Model  

Revenue distribution after collection:  

- **51% Founder** – stability anchor & long-term vision  
- **17% Investors & Partners** – includes investors, marketing, and hardware partners  
  - **5% of total revenue always goes to MicroPython** from this pool  
- **16% Hardware contributors** – rewarded by board sales and adoption  
- **16% Software contributors** – rewarded by repository metrics (and future usage statistics)  

### Current Status  
- Only software contributions merged into `master` are measured (by lines of code).  
- Usage metrics for applications/modules are **under development**.  
- Metrics and refinements will evolve **transparently** with community input.  

---

## Boundaries (Clarity)  

- Payouts are bounded by the contributor pools:  
  - **Up to 16% (HW)**  
  - **+ a share of 16% (SW)**  
- Even with one product, a partner can only capture **their share of 32% max**.  
- The micrOS core retains weighted shares in the SW pool.  

---

## Governance  

- **Voting rights scale with contribution weight** (software + hardware adoption).  
- Founder retains **51%** to prevent drift.  
- Shared costs (e.g., marketing) can be **voted on and transparently funded**.  

---

## Example Profit Scenario  

If micrOS generates **$100,000 revenue**:  

- $5,000 → **MicroPython** (from Investors & Partners pool)  
- Remaining $95,000:  
  - Founder: $51,000  
  - Investors & Partners: $12,000 (after MicroPython’s $5,000)  
  - Hardware contributors: $16,000  
  - Software contributors: $16,000  

### Example Partner  
- Pays $3,000 license fee on hardware profit.  
- Their board accounts for **20% of hardware sales → earns $3,200**.  
- Their tuned LM is used in **10% of devices → earns $1,600**.  
- **Net effect**: paid $3,000 → earned $4,800.  

⚖️ Even with a single product, they can never exceed **16% hardware + SW share**, because the micrOS core retains part of the pool.  

---

## Financial & Practical Notes  

- **Sustainable by design**: payouts are fixed-pool & adoption-driven.  
- **Future contracts** may use revenue-based fees or per-device royalties.  
- **Gradual rollout**:  
  - Start with current metrics (lines merged to `master`)  
  - Expand into usage-driven sharing  
- **Quarterly payouts**, with minimum thresholds to avoid micro-payments.  

---

## The Promise  

- Released under **AGPL-3.0** — ensuring improvements stay shared.  
- Once revenue justifies it, micrOS will form a company with:  
  - A **dual-license framework**  
  - Formal **legal enforcement**  
  - **Community support** in governance  

---

## Why micrOS is Different  

✅ **Profit-sharing open source** — for both hardware and software  
✅ **Respect for upstream** — 5% of all revenue goes to MicroPython  
✅ **Transparent & efficient** — visible metrics, fair rewards, no bloat  
✅ **Financially sound** — fixed-pool payouts keep incentives aligned
